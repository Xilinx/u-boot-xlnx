config FS_EROFS
	bool "Enable EROFS filesystem support"
	help
	  This provides support for reading images from EROFS filesystem.
	  EROFS (Enhanced Read-Only File System) is a lightweight read-only
	  file system for scenarios which need high-performance read-only
	  requirements.

	  It also provides fixed-sized output compression support, which
	  improves storage density, keeps relatively higher compression
	  ratios, which is more useful to achieve high performance for
	  embedded devices with limited memory.

config FS_EROFS_ZIP
	bool "EROFS Data Compression Support"
	depends on FS_EROFS
	select LZ4
	default y
	help
	  Enable fixed-sized output compression for EROFS.
	  If you don't want to enable compression feature, say N.

config FS_EROFS_ZIP_DEFLATE
	bool "EROFS DEFLATE compressed data support"
	depends on FS_EROFS_ZIP
	select ZLIB
	help
	  Saying Y here includes support for reading EROFS file systems
	  containing DEFLATE compressed data.  It gives better compression
	  ratios than the default LZ4 format, while it costs more CPU
	  overhead.

	  DEFLATE support is an experimental feature for now and so most
	  file systems will be readable without selecting this option.

	  If unsure, say N.
