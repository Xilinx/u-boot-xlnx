Please do not submit a Pull Request via github.  Our project makes use of
mailing lists for patch submission and review.  For more details please
see https://u-boot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/develop/sending_patches.html

The only exception to this is in order to trigger a CI loop on Azure prior
to posting of patches.

If your patch targets the Xilinx U-Boot repository please send a patch to git@xilinx.com.
